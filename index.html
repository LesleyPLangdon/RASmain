        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am Lesley Langdon, wife, mother, self-trained chef, weekend horticulturist, and cum laude graduate pursuing a new career in computer science and a MBA while dreaming of hiking the Appalachian Trail one day.  After careers as a restaurant manager and realtor I would like to combine my new skills with my existing talents to fulfill my passion for helping others find success.  I am actively looking for employment as a data analyst, project manager, or small business consultant. </p>

        <h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
        <h4>Personal mission statement: to encourage, guide, and support others on their path to success.</h4>
        <p>This applies to my family, clients, colleagues, and direct reports. In my home, we encourage each other to follow our dreams, whatever they are. Right now, my daughter wants to be a princess. It wouldn’t be my first choice for her, but I wanted to know more so I asked her why. Her 4-year-old response, “because they help people”. Talk about a proud mom moment. Anyway, I hope in time she realizes that she doesn’t need to marry Archie or Louis to help people, but I fully support her dreams.</p>
        <p>I developed this mission statement by looking back at my career and reflecting on what was most important to me in each position I held. I realized that helping others achieve success was a common thread and one that I am proud of. Before I talk more about how this trait showed itself in prior roles, I would like to talk about how I see it moving forward. There are three positions I am currently interested in pursuing: project manager, data analyst, and small business consultant. In some ways they are very different, but they all utilize my skills to help others achieve their goals. As a project manager I would use my leadership and organizational skills to help an organization by efficiently facilitating any type of project. As a data analyst I would call on my analytical and technological skills to help an organization understand their data and utilize it to make better business decisions. As a small business consultant, I would pull together all my skills, but especially my problem-solving skills, to help a small business find ways to run smoother and more efficiently taking advantage of technologies and tools they may not be familiar with. </p>
