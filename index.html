        <h1>A new way to get a website for your business</h1>
        <h2 class="text-center">
          Do you want a dynamic, custom website for your business, but you think
          it is either too much work or too expensive?

        <h2 class="text-center">Renting may be the right option for you!!</h2>

          <p>
            There certainly are free options out there but, first you need to
            learn how to use the software to build the free site and then you
            have to maintain it. Have you ever been to a site that still shows
            "upcoming events" from 2019? That happens a lot because business
            owners have other day to day concerns to prioritize, but my solution fixes that.

            width="30%"
          />
          <p>
            What can you do if you don't have the time to build and maintain a
            site? You can pay thousands of dollars for a custom site, then add on
            maintenance. If you conduct a significant amount of business through
            your website this may be the best option but if you just want a
            place for customers to find you and your contact information, it
            might be too much.

            Your third option is to rent a website. I offer customized websites
            for as little as $15 per month for a month-to-month rental with no
            long term commitment or an annual plan for $121, that's just $11 per
            month. All rentals include minor updates as needed. If your hours or
            services change, we will update your site for you at no cost. We
            even send out regular emails to ask if you need changes made. Sites
            with multiple pages or other features available for under $50 per
            month. Check out our <a href="prices.html">price list</a> for full
            details or <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> to get the ball
            rolling.
