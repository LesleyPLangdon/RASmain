        <h1>A new way to get a website for your business</h1>
        <h4>Do you want a dynamic, custom website for your business, but you think it is either too much work or too expensive?</h4>

            <div class="col-xs-4">
        <p >There certainly are free options out there but, first you need to learn how to use the software to build the free site and then you have to maintain it. Have you ever been to a site that still shows "upcoming events" from 2019? That happens a lot because business owners have other day to day concerns, but my solution fixes that.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-4">
        <p>What can you do if you don't have the time to build and maintain a site? You can pay thousands of dollars for a custom site with maintenance. If you conduct a significant amount of business through your website this may be the best option but if you just want a place for customers to find you and your contact information, it might be too much. </p>

        <p>Your third option is to rent a website. I offer customized websites for as little as $15 per month for a month-to-month rental with no long term commitment or an annual plan for $121, that's just $11 per month.  All rentals include minor updates as needed. If your hours or services change, we will update your site for you at no cost. We even send out regular emails to ask if you need changes made. Sites with multiple pages or other features available for under $50 per month. Check out our <a href="#prices">price list</a> for full details or <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to get the ball rolling.</p>
