            <p>Our single page site, often refered to as a landing page, has all your information in one spot. Click on the picture to the left (or above) to view the sample site.</p>
            <p>The image and text on the top is customized to suit your company. We can include a logo and text for a different look. The links you see will bring the user to that section of the page so they don't have to scroll through everything if all they want is contact information.</p>
            <p>You will provide the content. We recommend </p>
                <ol>
                <li>a blurb about you and/or your company</li>
                <li>information about the goods or services you provide</li>
                <li>contact information</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can add more or less, depending on what you are looking to achieve.</p>

            <a href="ThreePageIndex.html"><img class="image col-xs-3" src="images/ThreePageSample.jpg" alt="Three Page Site" width=400px /></a>
            <div class="col-xs-5">
            <p>When you move up to a multi pages site, the sections of the single page site all get their own page. If you want a lengthy description of your services or to include a lot of photos, I recommend this option. Click on the picture to the left (or above) to view the sample site.</p>
            <p>All of the same customizaiton is available but with even more flexibiltiy. The same header image across all pages gives continuity, but you could have different headers on each page. On a single page we recommend consistant formating so it flows well when someone does scroll all the way through. With multi page that isn't an issue so you can change your formating on each page.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure which option is right for you, don't worry, we will talk about your needs and find the best solution for you.</p>
